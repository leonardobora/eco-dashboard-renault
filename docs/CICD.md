# 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

## Overview

The EcoTI Dashboard project implements a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to ensure code quality, security, and reliability for the Renault Transformation Day 2025 sustainability monitoring solution.

## 🔧 Workflows

### 🧪 CI/CD Pipeline (`ci.yml`)

**Purpose**: Core testing and validation pipeline

**Triggers**:
- Push to `main` and `develop` branches
- Pull requests targeting `main` and `develop`

**Features**:
- **Multi-Python Testing**: Tests across Python 3.8-3.13
- **Cross-Platform**: Ubuntu and Windows compatibility
- **Code Quality**: Flake8 linting and Black formatting checks
- **Flask Testing**: Application startup and API endpoint validation
- **Coverage Reporting**: Test coverage with Codecov integration
- **Dependency Caching**: Optimized build times

**Matrix Strategy**:
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
    python-version: ['3.8', '3.9', '3.10', '3.11', '3.12', '3.13']
```

### 🔒 Security Analysis (`security.yml`)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive security scanning and vulnerability detection

**Triggers**:
- Push to `main` and `develop` branches
- Pull requests targeting `main` and `develop`
- Daily schedule at 2 AM UTC

**Security Checks**:
- **CodeQL Analysis**: GitHub's semantic code analysis for Python and JavaScript
- **Python Security (Bandit)**: Python-specific security issue detection
- **Dependency Safety**: Vulnerability scanning with Safety and pip-audit
- **Secrets Detection**: TruffleHog for credential exposure prevention
- **Dependency Review**: PR-based dependency change analysis

**Enterprise Features**:
- Security report artifacts with 30-day retention
- Automated security summaries in PR comments
- Fail-safe execution with detailed reporting

## 📊 Reporting & Monitoring

### Test Results
- **GitHub Actions Summary**: Real-time pipeline status
- **Codecov Integration**: Test coverage tracking and trends
- **Security Reports**: Downloadable JSON reports for compliance

### Quality Gates
- **Code Coverage**: Minimum coverage thresholds
- **Security Scanning**: Zero high-severity vulnerabilities
- **Code Style**: Black formatting and Flake8 compliance
- **Dependency Health**: No known vulnerable dependencies

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- **`main`**: Production-ready code
- **`develop`**: Integration branch for features
- **Feature branches**: Individual development work

### Pull Request Process
1. Create feature branch from `develop`
2. Implement changes with tests
3. Push branch (triggers CI/CD checks)
4. Create pull request to `develop`
5. Automated security and quality checks run
6. Code review and approval required
7. Merge after all checks pass

### Release Process
1. Merge `develop` to `main` when ready for release
2. Full CI/CD pipeline validation on `main`
3. Security scans and compliance checks
4. Automated deployment preparation

## 🛠️ Local Development

### Setup Development Environment
```bash
# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Run tests locally
pytest tests/ -v --cov=.

# Check code quality
black --check .
flake8 .

# Security scan
bandit -r .
safety check
```

### Pre-commit Hooks
```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Run all hooks manually
pre-commit run --all-files
```
